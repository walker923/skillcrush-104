				<p>Hi. I'm Bob. I'm 61 years old, generally not an age when people take on learning new things, especially things that are technology-related.</p>

				<p>Sometimes, the things I'm learning in Skillcrush seem overwhelming. The voices in my head start saying "You're too old for this," and "You're going to fail and make a fool of yourself."</p>

				<p>I have an old manual typewriter that sits on top of a bookshelf to remind me of my roots in writing and journalism. I literally started out in communications before the age of computers -- personal computers, at least. Yes, I'm that old.</p>

				<p>When I'm feeling lost in Skillcrush, I think that typewriter kind of looks at me and smirks.</p>

				<p>I still don't know if I'll really be able to succeed in this new field. But I was able to build and publish a website using only HTML and CSS, and it actually looks pretty good. I know what I'm doing on this particular page, what the various HTLM tags and CSS instructions mean. When that happens, I think that maybe I'll make it after all. One day at a time.</p>

				<p> Sometimes you have to ignore the voices in your head. Or tell them to shut the hell up.</p>
